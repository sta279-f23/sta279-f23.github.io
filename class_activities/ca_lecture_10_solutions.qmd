Here is full code for the roulette simulation:

```{python}
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(279)

nsim = 1000
results = np.zeros(nsim)
wheel = ["green"]*2 + ["black"]*18 + ["red"]*18

for i in range(nsim):
    money = 50
  
    while(0 < money < 100):
        spin = np.random.choice(wheel, size = 1)
        if spin == "red":
            money = money + 1
        else:
            money = money - 1
    
    results[i] = money == 100

np.mean(results)
```

**Notes:**

* This code takes advantage of some properties of Python lists: lists can be "added" together to combine them, and "multiplying" will repeat them
* Be careful with indenting. Remember that whitespace is important in Python!

### Other ways of coding

* `money = money + 1` can be written as `money += 1`
* `money = money - 1` can be written as `money -= 1`
* The `if...else...` statement can be rewritten in a sample line:

```{python, eval=F}
money = money + 1 if spin == "red" else money - 1
```
