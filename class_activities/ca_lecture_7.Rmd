**Instructions:** Work with a neighbor to answer the following questions, then we will discuss the activity as a class. To get started, download the [class activity template](https://sta279-f23.github.io/class_activities/ca_lecture_7_template.qmd) file.

## Practice with lists

1. Each of the following lists contains the vector `c(2, 7, 9)`. Determine the correct list indexing syntax to extract that vector from the list (your code should return just the vector, *not* a list containing the vector).

```{r, eval=F}
x1 <- list(c(2, 7, 9))
x2 <- list(list(c(2, 7, 9)))
x3 <- list(c(2, 7, 9), list("a", "b"))
x4 <- list(c("a", "b"), list(list(c(2, 7, 9))))
```

2. Create a list `x5` such that the vector `c(2, 7, 9)` can be extracted with `x5[[3]][[2]][[1]]`.

3. Create a list containing the following anonymous functions:

* `function(x) {return(x^2 - x)}`
* `function(x) {return(sin(x) + cos(x))}`
* `function(x) {return(exp(x)/x)}`

4. Use a `for` loop, and the `integrate` function, to integrate each of the functions from question 3 between 0 and 1.
