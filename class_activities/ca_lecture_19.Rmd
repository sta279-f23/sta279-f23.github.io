## Web scraping Taskmaster data

In this class activity, you will practice some web scraping Taskmaster data. You will need to load the `rvest` and `tidyverse` packages.

1. Following the class example of scraping Charlotte Ritchie's birthday, scrape the Series 15 champion from [https://taskmaster.fandom.com/wiki/Series_15](https://taskmaster.fandom.com/wiki/Series_15)

2. Write a `for` loop to create a vector containing the champion from each series (1 -- 15). As in homework, you can create a vector of urls for the different series with

```{r, eval=F}
paste0("https://taskmaster.fandom.com/wiki/Series_", 1:15)
```


3. Alex Horne, the creator of Taskmaster, has a band called The Horne Section. Their website has a list of their upcoming shows: [https://thehornesection.com/shows/](https://thehornesection.com/shows/). Extract the date of their next show.

4. Scrape Alex Horne's twitter url from [https://taskmaster.fandom.com/wiki/Alex_Horne](https://taskmaster.fandom.com/wiki/Alex_Horne).
